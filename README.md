# TowerDefense
 
Tower Defense is a 2D game. There is a path that contains waypoints and monsters follow the path between start and end points. And there is a button that generates towers around the path at random positions. Each tower might have to damage power anything between 10 units/sec - 50 units/sec. 

There are monsters born at the beginning of the path with 100 unit health. As the game progresses, more monsters start to be born at the beginning of the path. There is a scoreboard that's how many monsters were destroyed. The game is over when a monster reaches the end of the path.

With the save button the game state is saved and loading the saved game state on the application start.
